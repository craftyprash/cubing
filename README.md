## üìä Understanding Statistics

### Averaging Rules
CraftyCubing follows WCA (World Cube Association) averaging rules:

#### Average of 5 (ao5)
- Uses last 5 solves
- Removes best and worst times
- Averages remaining 3 times
- DNF if more than 1 DNF in the 5 solves

#### Average of 12+ (ao12, ao50, ao100)
- Uses specified number of recent solves
- Removes best and worst times
- Averages remaining times
- DNF if more than 1 DNF in the solve set

#### Single Times
- **Current**: Most recent solve in session
- **Best**: Fastest solve across all sessions
- **Penalty Handling**: +2 adds 2 seconds, DNF excluded from bests

### Personal Best Tracking
- **Automatic Detection**: New records detected immediately
- **Cross-Session**: Best times tracked across all sessions
- **Record Types**: Separate tracking for single, ao5, ao12, ao50, ao100
- **Celebration**: Confetti animation for new achievements

## üéØ Training Tips

### Effective Practice
1. **Warm Up**: Start each session with easy solves
2. **Focus Areas**: Use sessions to target specific skills
3. **Consistency**: Regular practice more effective than long sessions
4. **Analysis**: Review solve notes to identify patterns

### Using Sessions Effectively
- **Speed Sessions**: Focus on fast execution
- **Accuracy Sessions**: Prioritize error-free solves
- **Learning Sessions**: Practice new algorithms or methods
- **Competition Prep**: Simulate competition conditions

### Case Practice Strategy
1. **Learn Slowly**: Master algorithm execution before timing
2. **Multiple Algorithms**: Learn alternatives for different situations
3. **Recognition**: Practice case recognition separately
4. **Integration**: Gradually incorporate into full solves

### Progress Tracking
- **Regular Review**: Check statistics weekly
- **Goal Setting**: Set realistic improvement targets
- **Trend Analysis**: Look for patterns in your times
- **Celebrate Progress**: Acknowledge improvements, however small

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Timer Not Starting
- **Check Hold Time**: Ensure you hold for full 0.25 seconds
- **Avoid Quick Taps**: Timer requires deliberate hold action
- **Clear Browser Cache**: Refresh if timer becomes unresponsive

#### Statistics Not Updating
- **Refresh Page**: Force reload to update statistics
- **Check Session**: Ensure you're in the correct session
- **Verify Solves**: Confirm solves are being recorded

#### Mobile Touch Issues
- **Avoid Scrolling**: Don't scroll while touching timer area
- **Single Touch**: Use one finger for timer interaction
- **Clear Touch**: Lift finger completely between actions

#### Data Loss Prevention
- **Regular Practice**: Data saved automatically during use
- **Browser Storage**: Don't clear browser data unnecessarily
- **Multiple Devices**: Data is device-specific (no cloud sync)

### Performance Tips
- **Close Other Tabs**: Reduce browser memory usage
- **Regular Restart**: Restart browser occasionally
- **Update Browser**: Use latest browser version for best performance
